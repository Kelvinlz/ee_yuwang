<p>My research focuses on the control &operation of power systems and microgrids, with particular interests in multi-agent control, optimization, and learning approaches. Publications can be found in my [<a href="https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=GrrhGz0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a>]. It can be divided into the following three areas:</p>
<h2>1. Microgrid Control & Operation </h2>
<h3>a. Cyber-resilience analysis and enhancement in microgrid systems </h3>
<p>The cooperative secondary control of microgrids via communication systems increases the vulnerability of the system subject to unexpected malfunction and malicious cyber-attacks. The motivation of this research sub-area is to increase the resilience of cooperative control systems in cyber-physical microgrids under cyber disturbance and attacks. In our research, we are trying to deal with this problem from different stages. 
We have proposed a cooperative cyber-resilient control strategy to protect the bidirectional interlinking converters in networked microgrids. We have also proposed a novel detection method for deception attacks in isolated DC microgrids under distributed voltage control architecture. Small-signal modelling and stability analysis of distributed secondary control under communication delay is performed. Besides, a robust and resilient distributed frequency control strategy is proposed to manage the system subject to large and small extents of false data injection attacks. </p>

<h3>b. Distributed hierarchical control & operation of networked microgrid systems <br /></h3>
<p>Nowadays, a large amount of distributed energy resources has been integrated into power distribution systems, which forms microgrids and networked microgrids. The centralized control and operation structure encounter problems of high computation and communication burden, low system resilience, and scalability. The motivation of this research sub-area is to establish a distributed hierarchical control and operation structure of networked microgrids to address the above-mentioned problems. </p>
<p>In our research, we have proposed a multi-agent, multi-layer peer-to-peer control to achieve hierarchical control functions in networked microgrids.  A distributed event-triggered control has been proposed to reduce the communication burden of the secondary control system in microgrids. Besides, multiple control solutions are proposed for coordinated control of hybrid energy storage systems in microgrids. </p>

<h3>c. Cyber-physical hardware-in-the-loop design and testbed</h3>
<p>The distributed and cyber solutions of microgrids require validation in a near practical environment. Therefore, we have built up platforms with multi-agent system using embedded systems and PLCs and electrical systems on real-time simulators. </p>
<p>We have realized the remote real-time multi-agent control of microgrids. The distributed controllers are implemented on Raspberry Pis in UK and France and the. The electrical system and local controllers are emulated on OPAL-RT in Singapore. The data exchange is achieved by a cloud server on Redis. Besides, a literature review entitled 'Real-Time Coupling of Geographically Distributed Research Infrastructures: Taxonomy, Overview and Real-World Smart Grid Applications&rsquo; is accomplished to present the outputs of IEEE PES Task Force on Interfacing Techniques for Simulation Tools towards standardization of GDS as a concept. </p>

<h3>a. Frequency regulation in power systems by cooperative control and data-driven approaches <br /></h3>
<p>Frequency regulation is a major challenge in high renewable penetrated power systems. In our research, we proposed using distributed energy storage systems and controllable thermostatically load at demand side to participate in the system frequency regulation. Besides, data-driven approach to predict the short-term power fluctuation is proposed to assist the conventional frequency regulation process. </p>
