<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am currently a research scientist at Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate Lab, Singapore. I will join the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the [<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>] as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellow.</p>
<p>I received my Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Electrical adn Electronics Engineering from [<a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx">Nayang Technological University</a>] in 2017 and 2012, respectively. I got B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Automation from [<a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn/">Wuhan University</a>] in 2011. I have led multiple projects on energy storage systems, microgrids, power systems. I am the (co)author of more than 60 peer-reviewed journal papers and conference procedings, including 23 IEEE Transactions. I serve as the Associate Editor for IET Generation, Transmission &amp; Distribution, IET Smart Grid, Editor for Energy System, and Guest Editors for Frontiers in Energy Research. I currently serve as the Technical Committee Secretary of IEEE PES Task Force on Cloud-Based Control and Co-Simulation of Multi-PartyResources in Energy Internet and IEEE-PES Task Force on Networked Microgrid in Energy Internet. I am also the peer reviewer of journals and conferences in power and energy area of IEEE, IET and Elsevier.</p>
